Despite the apparent simplicity, this module deliver a wide sound palette.  
Although sound repeatability can be achieved, the circuit nature encourages the user toward an aleatoric sound design process. By tuning the three cross-modulated oscillators timbral metamorphosis with complex variations in tone and granularity can be accomplished.  
A little variation of the knob settings may result in dramatic timbral alterations, hence the name.   
A CV/GATE input is available to affect timbre, pitch and output volume.
